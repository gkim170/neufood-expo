# Neufood

Neufoodâ€™s goal is to help shared households reduce waste and save money by providing features such as ingredient tracking, expiration date monitoring, expense tracking, and a recipe recommendation system. The app will also include a receipt scanning feature to help manage grocery purchases.

## Projected Features

- **Ingredient Tracking**: Keep track of what ingredients are available in the pantry.
- **Expiration Date Tracker**: Get reminders for when items are about to expire.
- **Expense Tracker**: Monitor and manage grocery spending.
- **Recipe Recommendation System**: Find recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.
- **Receipt Scanning**: Easily add items to your pantry by scanning grocery receipts.

## Current Status

Right now, the app includes swipable information pages that introduce users to the features. These pages lead to the tab navigation system where future features will be implemented.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile application development.
- **Expo**: An open-source platform for making React Native apps.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Usage

At the moment, the app contains introductory pages that can be swiped through. These will eventually lead to different tabs within the app where users can access features like ingredient tracking and recipe recommendations.
